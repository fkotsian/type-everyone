#TypeEverything

Upload page exists - perhaps is just a modal?
	- name
	- upload (required)
	- dropdown of categories
Users can create a unique figure with a photo
Better flash message - flashes white on grey background across screen, fades out - javascript

Have selection menu be presented on page load



Users can view figures by category
Categories are displayed at the top of the page
Figures are displayed as thumbnails with their name and type (or "???") beneath
  - Gamify: the top 3 types, and number of votes for each, are displayed.
Clicking a category selects all figures of that category

Users can upload a new photo for an existing figure (Figures can have more than one photo)
Figures with multiple photos cycle through existing photos.
